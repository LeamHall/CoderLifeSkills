How to transition from Boot Camp or a Comp Sci degree into a Journeyman Coder


Boot Camps and formal education are businesses; their products are cirricula
and they market the ability to transfer knowledge in exchange for money. This 
isn't a bad thing, if you want those types of skills and you are driven enough
to use them to earn a living then it is a win-win solution.

## The Basic Theory

What if the cirricula doesn't match what you need for success? 

Putting a boot camp or college class takes a lot of time and money, and the 
organization has limits of both. Further, they have to ensure that any class 
they produce earns more than it costs to make and support. Trying to teach
everything isn't possible because different industries need different skills.
Boot camps teach you a broad base of currently needed skills, but may not have
the right depth or core for the industry you're targeting. Colleges often have 
depth usually focus on theory more than on modern application.

In the end, you are the one who needs to understand what skills you need, what
your career and life goals are, and how to achieve them. This project won't
tell you exactly what to do but it will help you frame the questions and begin
to find the answers.
